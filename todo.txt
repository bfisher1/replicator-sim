Refactor block code to be class hierarchy, not structs

Refactor anim to be class, better way of storing background colors

Add zoom for anims
  -need to add scaling of image size

done : Add anims for blocks

Add ability to toggle between worlds (robot inner worlds and real world)
  - for robots to see each other, allow blocks to be aware of robots on them

Add images for factory equipment

Refactor graphics draw sub image to use overriden methods, less copied code

Figure out better way to make make file

Clean up constants all over the place

remove blockAnimName function

centralize anims into block constructors

done : add timer event bus system. i.e. when after the timer goes off, execute function. i.e. after 2 mins, randomly update tree ages

should be observer pattern between world and updating blocks (printers, trees) where the world has list of each of these

use multiple threads in graphics

make select block a field on the bloc to make drawing easier

anim should have reference to its name

make plots, list of plots that clear out after each bot update. rendered as small dot on screen. list of double locs, lets u see more fine grained points

figure out better way to compare locs than copying operator< to every file

use cLion ide, CUDA for parallel stuff, maybe make game about bots fighting in space, like io

bots / ai should get separate thread to better handle their control flow
